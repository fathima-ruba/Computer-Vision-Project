# Project Name: Automated Urban Wildlife Habitat Identification

## Overview:
In the Automated Urban Wildlife Habitat Identification project, we developed a robust classification system for identifying and monitoring urban wildlife habitats using satellite imagery. The project leverages computer vision techniques to analyze Sentinel-2 satellite images and classify different land use and land cover categories associated with urban wildlife habitats.

## Methodology:
1. Preprocessed EuroSAT dataset for uniformity and quality.
2. Chose ResNet50 for its advanced capabilities in feature extraction.
3. Trained ResNet50 on EuroSAT dataset, adapting it for wildlife habitat classification.
4. Assessed ResNet50's accuracy.
5. Analyzed predictions for wildlife habitat classification tasks.

## Results:
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying urban wildlife habitats.
- Refer to the presentation slides for detailed project results and conclusions.

## Future Work:
- Incorporate temporal analysis of satellite imagery to monitor habitat changes over time.
- Collaborate with environmental agencies to deploy the classification system for real-world habitat monitoring and conservation efforts.
